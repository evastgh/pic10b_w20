* uninitialized variables: int, double, string, vector<int>
* operands:
```cpp
int a = 5, b = 1;
a = ++b;
b = a++;
cout << a << b; // should get 22
```
* passing by reference to a function
* scope, global variables
* declaring a class, what is a constructor?
* order of initialization/destructing of the variables
* vector: resize, reserve, ... see cppreference for more
* monstrosity of I/O buffer and cin.get()
